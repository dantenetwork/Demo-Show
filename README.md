# Demo videos

Many interesting dApps can be developed based on Dante protocol stack, and no matter which chain these dApps are deployed on, they can become dApps shared by the whole web3 world with the help of Dante.

We provide some demo videos to show how dApps can be improved with the help of Dante protocol stack.

* Smart contracts invocations between EVM chains and WASM chains. [Try it]().
* NFT published on Flow, and accessed from Ethereum(Opensea). [Try it]().
* Cross-Chain SWAP based on Dante protocol stack. [Try it]().
* Cross-chain privacy communication. [Try it]().
* Extend storage on Arweave to be accessed from other chains.
* Extend storage on Filecoin to be accessed from other chains.
