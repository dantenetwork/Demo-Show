# Demo Shows

Many interesting dApps can be developed based on Dante protocol stack. No matter which chain dApps are deployed on, their services and abilities can be shared to the whole Web3 ecosystems with the help of Dante.

### Application Demo
We provide some demo videos to show how dApps can be improved with the help of Dante protocol stack.

* Smart contracts invocations between EVM chains and WASM chains. 
    * This demo shows general message communication and contracts invocation between multi-chains.
    * [Try it manually](https://github.com/dantenetwork/cross-chain-demo/tree/high-level-show)
    * [Video Show](#smart-contracts-invocations-between-evm-chains-and-wasm-chains)
* NFT published on Flow, and accessed from Ethereum(Opensea). 
    * This demo shows an NFT minted on Flow can be visited from other chains like Ethereum(Opensea) with the help of Dante protocol stack.

* Cross-Chain SWAP based on Dante protocol stack. 
    * This demo is about a cross-chain SWAP based on Dante protocol stack. You can exchange `DANT` on BNB with `DANT` on Rinkeby(Ethereum Testnet)
    * [Try it manually](https://demo-swap-theta.vercel.app/)
* Cross-chain privacy communication. 
    * This is a very special demo. We know that Dante protocol stack provides `SQoS` mechanisms to scheduling security and scalability in various scenarios. But `Privacy` is a particularly special `SQoS` item, which is not for the scheduling but makes users in web3 world be able to communicate with each other anonymously and confidentiality between different chains. For example, someone can hold an anonymous poll on any of the chains, or an anonymous secret auction. With the help of this technology, every user can join no matter which chain they are familiar with.

    * [Video Show](#cross-chain-privacy-communication)
* Extend storage on Arweave to be accessed from other chains.
    * This demo shows the storage services can be extended to the whole web3 world. This is example to share special resources between different chains with the help of Dante protocol stack.

* Extend storage on Filecoin to be accessed from other chains.

### Algorithms Demo
To let users more easily understand how the underlyting Dante protocol stack workd, we will provide some demos that visually demonstrate how the underlying algorithm works.

* Routers evaluation algorithm demo
    * One of the key technologies.
    * [Try it manually](https://github.com/dantenetwork/Routers-Evaluation-Demo)
* Router selection algorithm demo
    * One of the key technologies.

## Highlights of Dante protocol stack
* Barrier-free multi-chain ecosystem Collaboration: Provision of a general data verification protocol to execute token circulation, comprehensive information sensing, and smart contract interoperability among multiple chains, like the “Block-Internet”.
* A dynamic balance between security, scalability, and decentralization: Provide an SQoS mechanism along with a tunable consensus verification architecture that can be adapted to various scenarios, just like the QoS in TCP/IP protocol cluster.
